QUAD:
      9. when I unblock someone gotta restart the app to have them shown in the Quad (weird since if convo deleted it shows right away)
      10. ppl don't disappear from Quad when messaged (fixed by a restart - make sure recyclerview updates)
      11. blocking doesn't make ppl disappear from the Quad right away (fixed by a restart - make sure recyclerview updates)
