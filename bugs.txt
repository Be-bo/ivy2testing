Android issues:
  1. when asking for membership the text gets tucked under "No Posts"; it's just a layout issue, just making sure textviews aren't overlaid over one another
  2. conversations get deleted by recyclerview doesn't update
  3. "you have no conversations"
  4. posting doesn't show up right away (for home posts)
  5. no posts yet even though I have some; across the whole app for all instances of the profile - it always thinks posts are empty no matter what
  6. no pics in chat at all - referring to the chat recycler - i.e. the preview pics
  7. when I already have a convo w/ someone (that they started) and I click "message" it creates a new convo (that only gets save when I send a message); you can actually leave if that's intended
  8. org profile trying to view oneself 3rd party - crash
  9. when I unblock someone gotta restart the app to have them shown in the Quad (weird since if convo deleted it shows right away)
  10. ppl don't disappear from Quad when messaged (fixed by a restart - make sure recyclerview updates)
  11. blocking doesn't make ppl disappear from the Quad right away (fixed by a restart - make sure recyclerview updates)
  12. menu bar doesn't update in chat (Eg. when going in there from events or home the create button stays)
